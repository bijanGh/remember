# Intro

we are going to put tasks in this file and mark them as done or not done. we are going to use the following format for each task:

```markdown
- [ ] Task Name
```

we also can add a description to the task like this:

```markdown
- [ ] Task Name
  - Task Description
```

diagramming is done by leveraging [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). we are going to put the diagram in the `/diagrams` folder and link it in the task description.

each section also starts with an H2
